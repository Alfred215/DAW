                <strong>Imagine a folk festival with many different tents</strong>  -- tenis for all diferent sorts of music,
                a tent where you learn how to fiddle, and maybe one where you make drums. Each has its focus.
                People move from tent to tent making their own experience.<br><br>
                <strong>The Drumbeat Festival will work exactly like this.</strong>  We'll have all kinds of spaces
                where you can teach and learn -- studios, labs, playgrounds, classrooms, and even
                a few tents in the public square. Each space will provide a place to dive deep and get your
                hands dirty with some of the most interesting at the intersection of learning, freedom and the web.

                The open nature of the internet is revolutionizing how we learn. Mozilla's 2010

                the world who are at the heart of this revolution. Join us in Barcelona for three
                days of making, teaching, hacking inventing and shaping the future of education and the web. <a href="#">learn more.</a>
